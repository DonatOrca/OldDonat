    <p>Arturia Giallo is the distant cousin of Federico Giallo the Executor who is noted for her musical talents since her childhood. She was raised up together with Federico since childhood as she is the daughter of Marcello, the cousin of Federico's father, and Luciana, and Federico had been treating her as a sisterly figure. However, after her mother read her a story which expressed that being free is what makes you truly happy, she used her Arts to convince her mother to chase her desire of being a wartime photographer. After being accused by her father for Luciana's tragic death months later, and the chaos at her funeral where the attendants were greatly affected by her Arts, she was in some ways disavowed by her father by being sent to Leithanien for musical studies where she was mentored by a loyalist of the Witch King.</p>
